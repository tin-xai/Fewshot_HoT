Reformatted Question: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a bus, a motorcycle, a hatchback, a station wagon, a minivan, a truck, and a limousine. <fact1>The station wagon is the fourth-newest</fact1>. <fact2>The motorcycle is newer than the truck</fact2>. <fact3>The station wagon is older than the hatchback</fact3>. <fact4>The minivan is newer than the hatchback</fact4>. <fact5>The bus is newer than the minivan</fact5>. <fact6>The truck is newer than the limousine</fact6>. Options: (A) The bus is the third-oldest (B) The motorcycle is the third-oldest (C) The hatchback is the third-oldest (D) The station wagon is the third-oldest (E) The minivan is the third-oldest (F) The truck is the third-oldest (G) The limousine is the third-oldest
Answer: To determine which vehicle is the third-oldest, we need to analyze the given facts: 1. <fact1>The station wagon is the fourth-newest</fact1>: This means there are three vehicles that are newer than the station wagon. 2. <fact2>The motorcycle is newer than the truck</fact2>: This indicates that the motorcycle is not the oldest and is positioned above the truck in terms of age. 3. <fact3>The station wagon is older than the hatchback</fact3>: This means the hatchback is newer than the station wagon. 4. <fact4>The minivan is newer than the hatchback</fact4>: This places the minivan above the hatchback in terms of age. 5. <fact5>The bus is newer than the minivan</fact5>: This means the bus is the newest among the minivan and the hatchback. 6. <fact6>The truck is newer than the limousine</fact6>: This indicates that the limousine is older than the truck. Now, let's summarize the order based on the information: - Since <fact1>the station wagon is the fourth-newest</fact1>, we can denote the order as follows: - 1st: Bus (newest) - 2nd: Minivan (newer than hatchback) - 3rd: Motorcycle (newer than truck) - 4th: Station Wagon (given) - 5th: Hatchback (older than station wagon) - 6th: Truck (newer than limousine) - 7th: Limousine (oldest) From this arrangement, we can see that the third-oldest vehicle is the motorcycle. The answer is {B}.
