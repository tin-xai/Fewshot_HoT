Question: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a bus, a motorcycle, a hatchback, a station wagon, a minivan, a truck, and a limousine. The station wagon is the fourth-newest. The motorcycle is newer than the truck. The station wagon is older than the hatchback. The minivan is newer than the hatchback. The bus is newer than the minivan. The truck is newer than the limousine. Options: (A) The bus is the third-oldest (B) The motorcycle is the third-oldest (C) The hatchback is the third-oldest (D) The station wagon is the third-oldest (E) The minivan is the third-oldest (F) The truck is the third-oldest (G) The limousine is the third-oldest
Answer: To determine which vehicle is the third-oldest, we need to analyze the given facts: 1. The station wagon is the fourth-newest: This means there are three vehicles that are newer than the station wagon. 2. The motorcycle is newer than the truck: This indicates that the motorcycle is not the oldest and is positioned above the truck in terms of age. 3. The station wagon is older than the hatchback: This means the hatchback is newer than the station wagon. 4. The minivan is newer than the hatchback: This places the minivan above the hatchback in terms of age. 5. The bus is newer than the minivan: This means the bus is the newest among the minivan and the hatchback. 6. The truck is newer than the limousine: This indicates that the limousine is older than the truck. Now, let's summarize the order based on the information: - Since the station wagon is the fourth-newest, we can denote the order as follows: - 1st: Bus (newest) - 2nd: Minivan (newer than hatchback) - 3rd: Motorcycle (newer than truck) - 4th: Station Wagon (given) - 5th: Hatchback (older than station wagon) - 6th: Truck (newer than limousine) - 7th: Limousine (oldest) From this arrangement, we can see that the third-oldest vehicle is the motorcycle. The answer is {B}.
