Reformatted Question: A <fact1>3-month-old baby</fact1> died <fact2>suddenly at night while asleep</fact2>. His mother noticed that he had died only after she awoke in the morning. <fact3>No cause of death was determined based on the autopsy</fact3>. Which of the following precautions could have prevented the death of the baby? A) Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping B) Routine postnatal electrocardiogram (ECG) C) Keeping the infant covered and maintaining a high room temperature D) Application of a device to maintain the sleeping position E) Avoiding pacifier use during sleep
Answer: Let's think step by step. The <fact1>3-month-old baby</fact1> <fact2>died suddenly at night while asleep</fact2>, and the <fact3>autopsy did not determine a cause of death</fact3>, which is indicative of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). One of the most effective precautions against SIDS is placing the <fact1>infant</fact1> in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping. This position reduces the risk of the <fact1>infant</fact1> <fact2>suffocating while sleeping</fact2>. Therefore, the precaution that could have prevented the baby's death is option {A}.

Question: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation? A) Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud B) Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize C) Error in neural crest cell migration D) Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus E) Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline

He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past <fact2>4 days</fact2>, he has been fussy, is <fact3>regurgitating all of his feeds</fact3>, and his <fact4>vomit is yellow in color</fact4>. On physical exam, the child's <fact5>abdomen is minimally distended</fact5> but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation? A) Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud B) Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize C) Error in neural crest cell migration D) Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus E) Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
Answer: Evaluating the <fact1>3-week-old infant</fact1> who has been experiencing <fact3>regurgitating all of his feeds</fact3> with <fact4>yellow vomit</fact4> for the past <fact2>4 days</fact2> suggests a possible intestinal obstruction. The <fact4>yellow vomit</fact4> indicates that the vomit is bilious, meaning the obstruction is distal to the ampulla of Vater. Additionally, the <fact5>abdomen is minimally distended</fact5>, which rules out conditions that would cause significant abdominal swelling. Among the provided options, the complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize is consistent with duodenal atresia, an embryologic error that leads to bilious vomiting and minimal abdominal distension. Therefore, the embryologic error responsible for this presentation is {B}.

Which of the following is the most likely pathogenesis for the present findings Options: (A) Thromboembolism (B) Pulmonary ischemia (C) Pulmonary hypertension (D) Pulmonary passive congestion (E) Pulmonary hemorrhage
Reformatted Question: A pulmonary autopsy specimen from a <fact1>58-year-old woman</fact1> who died of <fact2>acute hypoxic respiratory failure</fact2> was examined. She had recently undergone surgery for a <fact3>fractured femur</fact3> 3 months ago. Initial hospital course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged to a rehab facility in good health. Shortly after discharge home from rehab, she developed <fact4>sudden shortness of breath</fact4> and had <fact5>cardiac arrest</fact5>. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. On histological examination of lung tissue, <fact6>fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery</fact6> is observed. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenesis for the present findings Options: (A) Thromboembolism (B) Pulmonary ischemia (C) Pulmonary hypertension (D) Pulmonary passive congestion (E) Pulmonary hemorrhage
Answer: Considering the <fact1>58-year-old woman</fact1> had a history of recent surgery for a <fact3>fractured femur</fact3>, she was at increased risk for blood clots due to immobilization. The development of <fact4>sudden shortness of breath</fact4> followed by <fact5>cardiac arrest</fact5> suggests an acute event such as a pulmonary embolism. The presence of <fact6>fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery</fact6> further supports the formation of a thrombus within the pulmonary artery. Given these factors, the most likely pathogenesis is <fact2>acute hypoxic respiratory failure</fact2> caused by a thromboembolism. Therefore, the answer is {A}.

Question: A 68-year-old man comes to the physician because of recurrent episodes of nausea and abdominal discomfort for the past 4 months. The discomfort is located in the upper abdomen and sometimes occurs after eating, especially after a big meal. He has tried to go for a walk after dinner to help with digestion, but his complaints have only increased. For the past 3 weeks he has also had symptoms while climbing the stairs to his apartment.

A blood culture is most likely to show which of the following? A) Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci forming mauve-colored colonies on methicillin-containing agar B) Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar C) Spore-forming, gram-positive bacilli forming yellow colonies on casein agar D) Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar E) Gamma-hemolytic, gram-positive cocci forming green colonies on vancomycin agar
Answer: Let's think step by step. The patient had <fact1>fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain</fact1>. Her vital signs indicate a high <fact2>temperature of 39.1°C (102.3°F)</fact2>, an elevated <fact3>pulse of 126/min</fact3>, increased <fact4>respirations at 28/min</fact4>, and a low <fact5>blood pressure of 80/50 mm Hg</fact5>, which are signs of sepsis. The presence of <fact6>blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line</fact6> suggests a possible bloodstream infection. The <fact8>mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os</fact8> and <fact9>left adnexal tenderness</fact9> found during the <fact7>pelvic examination</fact7> point towards pelvic inflammatory disease. Laboratory results show a <fact10>significantly low platelet count</fact10>, <fact11>decreased fibrinogen</fact11>, and <fact12>elevated D-dimer</fact12>, all of which are indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The identification of a <fact13>phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain</fact13> when phenol is applied suggests the presence of lipopolysaccharides typical of certain Gram-negative bacteria. Among the options provided, choice D describes a lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rod forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar, which is characteristic of Escherichia coli, a common pathogen responsible for severe infections leading to sepsis and DIC. The answer is {D}.
