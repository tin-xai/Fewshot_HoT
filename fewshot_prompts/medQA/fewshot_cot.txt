Question: A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation presents with burning upon urination. She states it started 1 day ago and has been worsening despite drinking more water and taking cranberry extract. She otherwise feels well and is followed by a doctor for her pregnancy. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 122/77 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of costovertebral angle tenderness and a gravid uterus. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient? Options: (A) Ampicillin (B) Ceftriaxone (C) Ciprofloxacin (D) Doxycycline (E) Nitrofurantoin
Answer: Analyzing the situation, the 23-year-old pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation is presenting with symptoms consistent with a urinary tract infection, specifically burning upon urination that started 1 day ago and has not improved with increased water intake and cranberry extract. Her vital signs are stable with a normal temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and oxygen saturation. The absence of costovertebral angle tenderness suggests that the infection is likely uncomplicated and has not ascended to the kidneys. Given that she is pregnant, the choice of antibiotic must be safe for both her and the fetus. Among the options, Nitrofurantoin is considered safe and effective for treating uncomplicated urinary tract infections during pregnancy. Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient is {E}.

Question: A 3-month-old baby died suddenly at night while asleep. His mother noticed that he had died only after she awoke in the morning. No cause of death was determined based on the autopsy. Which of the following precautions could have prevented the death of the baby? A) Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping B) Routine postnatal electrocardiogram (ECG) C) Keeping the infant covered and maintaining a high room temperature D) Application of a device to maintain the sleeping position E) Avoiding pacifier use during sleep
Answer: Let's think step by step. The 3-month-old baby died suddenly at night while asleep, and the autopsy did not determine a cause of death, which is indicative of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). One of the most effective precautions against SIDS is placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping. This position reduces the risk of the infant suffocating while sleeping. Therefore, the precaution that could have prevented the baby's death is option {A}.

Question: A mother brings her 3-week-old infant to the pediatrician's office because she is concerned about his feeding habits. He was born without complications and has not had any medical problems up until this time. However, for the past 4 days, he has been fussy, is regurgitating all of his feeds, and his vomit is yellow in color. On physical exam, the child's abdomen is minimally distended but no other abnormalities are appreciated. Which of the following embryologic errors could account for this presentation? A) Abnormal migration of ventral pancreatic bud B) Complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize C) Error in neural crest cell migration D) Abnormal hypertrophy of the pylorus E) Failure of lateral body folds to move ventrally and fuse in the midline
Answer: Evaluating the 3-week-old infant who has been experiencing regurgitating all of his feeds with yellow vomit for the past 4 days suggests a possible intestinal obstruction. The yellow vomit indicates that the vomit is bilious, meaning the obstruction is distal to the ampulla of Vater. Additionally, the abdomen is minimally distended, which rules out conditions that would cause significant abdominal swelling. Among the provided options, the complete failure of proximal duodenum to recanalize is consistent with duodenal atresia, an embryologic error that leads to bilious vomiting and minimal abdominal distension. Therefore, the embryologic error responsible for this presentation is {B}.

Question: A pulmonary autopsy specimen from a 58-year-old woman who died of acute hypoxic respiratory failure was examined. She had recently undergone surgery for a fractured femur 3 months ago. Initial hospital course was uncomplicated, and she was discharged to a rehab facility in good health. Shortly after discharge home from rehab, she developed sudden shortness of breath and had cardiac arrest. Resuscitation was unsuccessful. On histological examination of lung tissue, fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery is observed. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenesis for the present findings Options: (A) Thromboembolism (B) Pulmonary ischemia (C) Pulmonary hypertension (D) Pulmonary passive congestion (E) Pulmonary hemorrhage
Answer: Considering the 58-year-old woman had a history of recent surgery for a fractured femur, she was at increased risk for blood clots due to immobilization. The development of sudden shortness of breath followed by cardiac arrest suggests an acute event such as a pulmonary embolism. The presence of fibrous connective tissue around the lumen of the pulmonary artery further supports the formation of a thrombus within the pulmonary artery. Given these factors, the most likely pathogenesis is acute hypoxic respiratory failure caused by a thromboembolism. Therefore, the answer is {A}.

Question: A 68-year-old man comes to the physician because of recurrent episodes of nausea and abdominal discomfort for the past 4 months. The discomfort is located in the upper abdomen and sometimes occurs after eating, especially after a big meal. He has tried to go for a walk after dinner to help with digestion, but his complaints have only increased. For the past 3 weeks he has also had symptoms while climbing the stairs to his apartment. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 2 peripheral arterial disease. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years. He drinks one to two beers daily and occasionally more on weekends. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, and aspirin. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 126 kg (278 lb); BMI is 45 kg/m². His temperature is 36.4°C (97.5°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 148/86 mm Hg. On physical examination, the abdomen is soft and nontender with no organomegaly. Foot pulses are absent bilaterally. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
A) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
B) CT scan of the abdomen
C) Hydrogen breath test
D) Cardiac stress test 
E) Abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant
Answer: Considering the 68-year-old man's symptoms of recurrent episodes of nausea and abdominal discomfort that occur after eating, especially after a big meal, along with the development of symptoms while climbing the stairs to his apartment over the past 3 weeks, it is important to evaluate for potential cardiac causes. His significant medical history, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and stage 2 peripheral arterial disease, along with a long history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years, increases his risk for coronary artery disease. Additionally, the absence of ECG abnormalities does not rule out cardiac ischemia. Given these factors, the most appropriate next step is to perform a cardiac stress test to assess for ischemic heart disease. Therefore, the answer is {D}.

Question: A 27-year-old female presents to a general medical clinic for a routine checkup. She has a genetic disease marked by a mutation in a chloride transporter. She has a history of chronic bronchitis. Which of the following is most likely true regarding a potential vitamin deficiency complication secondary to this patient's chronic illness? A) It may result in connective tissue defects
B) It may result in corneal vascularization
C) It may result in the triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia
D) It may be exacerbated by excessive ingestion of raw eggs
E) It may manifest itself as a prolonged PT
Answer: The patient is a 27-year-old female with a genetic disease involving a mutation in a chloride transporter, which is indicative of Cystic Fibrosis. This condition is associated with a history of chronic bronchitis and affects multiple systems, including the digestive system, leading to malabsorption issues that can cause vitamin deficiency complications. Specifically, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) are commonly deficient. Among the options provided, a vitamin K deficiency would result in impaired blood clotting, which is measured by a prolonged prothrombin time (PT). The answer is {E}.

Question: A 69-year-old male presents to the emergency room with back pain. He has a history of metastatic prostate cancer and was not a candidate for surgical resection. He began chemotherapy but discontinued due to unremitting nausea. He denies any bowel or bladder incontinence. He has never had pain like this before and is demanding morphine. The nurse administers IV morphine and he feels more comfortable. Vital signs are stable. On physical examination you note tenderness to palpation along the lower spine, weakness in the bilateral lower extremities, left greater than right. Neurological examination is also notable for hyporeflexia in the knee and ankle jerks bilaterally. You conduct a rectal examination, which reveals saddle anesthesia. Regarding this patient, what is the most likely diagnosis and the appropriate next step in management?
A) The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and steroids should be started prior to MRI
B) The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and steroids should be started after to MRI
C) The most likely diagnosis is cauda equina syndrome and the patient should be rushed to radiation
D) The most likely diagnosis is conus medullaris syndrome and steroids should be started prior to MRI
E) The most likely diagnosis is conus medullaris syndrome and steroids should be started after to MRI
Answer: Evaluating the patient's presentation, the 69-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer is experiencing back pain accompanied by tenderness to palpation along the lower spine, weakness in the bilateral lower extremities with left greater than right, and saddle anesthesia. These symptoms are highly indicative of cauda equina syndrome, a medical emergency that necessitates immediate intervention to prevent permanent neurological damage. The appropriate next step in management is to initiate steroids prior to MRI to reduce inflammation and expedite diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is {A}.

Question: A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 126/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line. Pelvic examination shows mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness. Laboratory studies show: Platelet count 14,200/mm³ Fibrinogen 83 mg/mL (N = 200–430 mg/dL) D-dimer 965 ng/mL (N < 500 ng/mL) When phenol is applied to a sample of the patient's blood at 90°C, a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain is identified. A blood culture is most likely to show which of the following? A) Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci forming mauve-colored colonies on methicillin-containing agar B) Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar C) Spore-forming, gram-positive bacilli forming yellow colonies on casein agar D) Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar E) Gamma-hemolytic, gram-positive cocci forming green colonies on vancomycin agar
Answer: Let's think step by step. The patient had fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain. Her vital signs indicate a high temperature of 39.1°C (102.3°F), an elevated pulse of 126/min, increased respirations at 28/min, and a low blood pressure of 80/50 mm Hg, which are signs of sepsis. The presence of blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line suggests a possible bloodstream infection. The mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness found during the pelvic examination point towards pelvic inflammatory disease. Laboratory results show a significantly low platelet count, decreased fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer, all of which are indicative of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The identification of a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain when phenol is applied suggests the presence of lipopolysaccharides typical of certain Gram-negative bacteria. Among the options provided, choice D describes a lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rod forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar, which is characteristic of Escherichia coli, a common pathogen responsible for severe infections leading to sepsis and DIC. The answer is {D}.
