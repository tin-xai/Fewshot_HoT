Question: You have been given a circular path consisting of 12 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a computer keyboard. Moving in a clockwise direction from the computer keyboard, the elements on the path are a library, a mailbox, a parachute, a Granny Smith, a plate, a Komodo dragon, a southern black widow, a quail, a forklift, a medicine chest, and a hornbill. Starting from the southern black widow, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find? Your final answer must be only the object name (e.g., laptop). If you have not previously seen the object at the vertex, your final answer must be "unknown".

Answer: Let me trace this path carefully:
The circular path has 12 objects in clockwise order: computer keyboard (starting point at top), library, mailbox, parachute, Granny Smith, plate, Komodo dragon, <fact1>southern black widow</fact1>, quail, forklift, medicine chest, and hornbill.
<fact2>I need to start from the southern black widow and follow these movements:
Move 4 steps counter-clockwise
Move 4 steps counter-clockwise again
Move 8 steps clockwise</fact2>
Starting from the southern black widow:
First move: 4 steps counter-clockwise brings me to the Granny Smith
Second move: 4 more steps counter-clockwise brings me to the hornbill
Third move: 8 steps clockwise from the hornbill brings me back to the southern black widow
So after completing all these movements, I will find a southern black widow. The answer is {southern black widow}.
