Question: Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of heels costs $1534633 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?
Answer:The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair of heels, which is $1534633 * 2 = $3069266. Together, the two pairs of heels cost $1534633 + $3069266 = $4603899. The boots cost five dollars more than the heels, so the boots cost $4603899 + 5 = $4603904. The answer is {4603904}.

Question: On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. His total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?
Answer:On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, Walt walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, which is 6 * 4 miles = 24 miles. Walt's total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, and he walked 4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday. So, on Wednesday, Walt walked 41 miles - 28 miles = 13 miles. The answer is {13}.

Question: Jake is walking through the Museum of Entomology. He sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, 90 insects with 6 legs each, and 2704418 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. How many legs does Jake see total?
Answer:To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature and then add them up. For the spiders, we have 80 spiders * 8 legs each = 640 legs. For the insects, we have 90 insects * 6 legs each = 540 legs. For the rare mutant invertebrates, we have 2704418 invertebrates * 10 legs each = 27044180 legs. Now, let's add up the total number of legs: 640 + 540 + 27044180 = 27045360 legs. The answer is {27045360}.

Question: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses and 700$ to his wife to budget for groceries and other household goods. If Zaid earns 6000$ per month, how much money will he still have after all these expenses and donations?
Answer: Zaid's rent costs are 1/4 * 6000$ = 1500$. His car fuel costs are 1/3 * 6000$ = 2000$. The total cost of rent and car fuel is 1500$ + 2000$ = 3500$. This leaves Zaid with 6000$ - 3500$ = 2500$. Zaid then donates half of the remaining amount, which is 1/2 * 2500$ = 1250$. This leaves Zaid with 2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$. Zaid then gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, for a total of 200$ + 700$ = 900$. This leaves Zaid with 1250$ - 900$ = 350$. The answer is {350}.

Question: Violetta wants to buy new crayons. She needs them in 5 different colors and prepared $965589 for this purchase. One crayon costs $2. How much change will she get?
