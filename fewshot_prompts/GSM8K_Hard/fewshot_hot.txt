Reformatted Question: Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost <fact1>five dollars less than the boots</fact1>. If one pair of heels costs <fact2>$1534633</fact2> and the other costs <fact3>twice as much</fact3>, how many dollars are the boots?
Answer: The other pair of heels costs <fact3>twice as much</fact3> as the first pair of heels, which is <fact2>$1534633</fact2> * 2 = $3069266. Together, the two pairs of heels cost <fact2>$1534633</fact2> + $3069266 = $4603899. The boots cost <fact1>five dollars more than the heels</fact1>, so the boots cost $4603899 + 5 = $4603904. The answer is {4603904}.

Answer: Ryan plants <fact1>4063648 flowers a day</fact1> in his garden. So, in <fact2>15 days</fact2>, he would have planted <fact1>4063648</fact1> * <fact2>15</fact2> = 60954720 flowers. However, <fact3>5 did not grow</fact3>, so he actually has 60954720 - 5 = 60954715 flowers. The answer is {60954715}.

Question: On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. His total mileage Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?
Reformatted Question: On Monday, Walt walked <fact1>4 miles</fact1>. Tuesday, he walked <fact2>6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday</fact2>. His total mileage Monday through Wednesday was <fact3>41 miles</fact3>. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?
Answer: On Monday, Walt walked <fact1>4 miles</fact1>. On Tuesday, Walt walked <fact2>6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday</fact2>, which is <fact2>6</fact2> * <fact1>4 miles</fact1> = 24 miles. Walt's total mileage Monday through Wednesday was <fact3>41 miles</fact3>, and he walked <fact1>4 miles</fact1> + 24 miles = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday. So, on Wednesday, Walt walked <fact3>41 miles</fact3> - 28 miles = 13 miles. The answer is {13}.

Question: Jake is walking through the Museum of Entomology. He sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, 90 insects with 6 legs each, and 2704418 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each. How many legs does Jake see total?
Reformatted Question: Jake is walking through the Museum of Entomology. He sees <fact1>80 spiders</fact1> with <fact2>8 legs each</fact2>, <fact3>90 insects</fact3> with <fact4>6 legs each</fact4>, and <fact5>2704418 rare mutant invertebrates</fact5> with <fact6>10 legs each</fact6>. How many legs does Jake see total?
Answer: To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature and then add them up. For the spiders, we have <fact1>80 spiders</fact1> * <fact2>8 legs each</fact2> = 640 legs. For the insects, we have <fact3>90 insects</fact3> * <fact4>6 legs each</fact4> = 540 legs. For the rare mutant invertebrates, we have <fact5>2704418 invertebrates</fact5> * <fact6>10 legs each</fact6> = 27044180 legs. Now, let's add up the total number of legs: 640 + 540 + 27044180 = 27045360 legs. The answer is {27045360}.

Question: Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. He gives his daughter 200$ to use for her weekly expenses and 700$ to his wife to budget for groceries and other household goods. If Zaid earns 6000$ per month, how much money will he still have after all these expenses and donations?
Reformatted Question: Zaid spends <fact1>1/4 of his salary on rent</fact1>, <fact2>1/3 on car fuel</fact2> and donates <fact3>half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity</fact3>. He gives his daughter <fact4>200$ to use for her weekly expenses</fact4> and <fact5>700$ to his wife to budget for groceries and other household goods</fact5>. If Zaid earns <fact6>6000$ per month</fact6>, how much money will he still have after all these expenses and donations?
Answer: Zaid's rent costs are <fact1>1/4</fact1> * <fact6>6000$</fact6> = 1500$. His car fuel costs are <fact2>1/3</fact2> * <fact6>6000$</fact6> = 2000$. The total cost of rent and car fuel is 1500$ + 2000$ = 3500$. This leaves Zaid with <fact6>6000$</fact6> - 3500$ = 2500$. Zaid then donates <fact3>half of the remaining amount</fact3>, which is <fact3>1/2</fact3> * 2500$ = 1250$. This leaves Zaid with 2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$. Zaid then gives his daughter <fact4>200$</fact4> and his wife <fact5>700$</fact5>, for a total of 200$ + 700$ = 900$. This leaves Zaid with 1250$ - 900$ = 350$. The answer is {350}.
